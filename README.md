## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all of the files necessary to use our snippets.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file that defines the location of the snippet files and specifies the language of the snippets.
* `snippets/*.code-snippets` - the files containing all snippets.

## Snippet list

* Command- and Query- Handlers

## Installing the snippets
