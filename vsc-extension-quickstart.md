# Welcome to your VS Code Extension

## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file that defines the location of the snippet file and specifies the language of the snippets.
* `snippets/snippets.code-snippets` - the file containing all snippets.

## Get up and running straight away

* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Create a new file with a file name suffix matching your language.
* Verify that your snippets are proposed on IntelliSense.

## Make changes

* You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after making changes to the files listed above.
* You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.

## Generate snippets from templates

* You can generate snippets from a template using the `npm run generate` command.
* You will be asked to provide a name, a prefix, a description and a language for your new snippet.
* You will then have to provide the path to your template written in a TextMate snippet format.
* Templates are usually found in the `templates` folder.
* You can also update existing templates that way by entering an existing name.

## Install your extension

* To start using your extension with Visual Studio Code copy it into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.
* To share your extension with the world, read on https://code.visualstudio.com/docs about publishing an extension.
